              My name is Andr&eacute; Grech and I'm an aspiring full stack developer. My goal is to refine my skills in order to showcase a skillset that is both technically adept and creative in implementation, empowering myself to pursue personal and professional goals. 
              It is my hope that the work I currently have on display will demonstrate that I have a strong aptitude for learning and growth within a condensed timeframe. As a Technology Consultant in professional services, I have been exposed to a broad range of stages in the
              development process and have worked with a range of platforms such as Azure Synapse Studio, Databricks and Microsoft Power Platform.
            </p>      
            <p class="col-sm-12 non-head-text">
              My experience as a graduate of science and languages has already
              exposed me to very self-guided and rigorous learning scenarios. I'm prepared to keep driving myself learn, absorb new skills, and really take advantage of the opportunities afforded to us in such a digital age. 
              Outside of this I'm the eldest of 4, so I'm no stranger to working in in close quarters and conflict resolution. I'm avid adult fan of Lego (AFOL), spend time building computers from scratch, and enjoy cycling and reading outside of work.</p>
            </p>
            <p class="col-sm-12 non-head-text">
              I enjoy playing as well as watching sport in my down time. Don't get me started on how overly invested in the Fifa World Cup I've been. 
              My portfolio currently contains some of my highlighted works in the 6 months I was engaged in a bootcamp. You can check out the repos and view them in deployed states on github pages, and in some cases hosted by Heroku (Down due to recent security breach). You can browse my portfolio or can access my github directly <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AGr2020Xman">here</a>.
              Hopefully you can appreciate how much I've managed to learn in such a short time, and how much further I can still grow and develop as my learning continues to advance.
